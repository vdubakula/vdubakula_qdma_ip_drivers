Common Steps:
1. Copy perf_scripts folder to dpdk root directory.
2. Run setup.sh present in perf_scripts folder.
3. Bind the device to be used for performance to igb_uio device.

Forwarding performance using TestPMD:

0. Install expect package if not already installed on Machine. (apt-get install expect)
1. cd to directory perf_scripts/tespmd.
2. Run ./testpmd_perf.sh B:D.f CmptLen_PfchEN ...
	where
	B:D.f is the PCI_ID of the device to be used for performance.
	CmptLen is completion entry size
	PfchEN is prefetch enable(1)/disable(0)
3. Example command: ./testpmd_perf.sh 02:00.0 8_0 16_1 
	This command will run testPMD performance on 02:00.0 device for 8 byte descriptor size with prefetch disable and 16 byte descriptor with prefetch enable.

4. latecy and performance results will be available in testpmd_{dsc_size}{pfch_enabled}.csv file.

C2H and H2C performance using pktgen:
1. copy the content of directory perf_scripts/pktgen to pktgen-dpdk root directory.
2. cd to pktgen-dpdk root directory.
3. run ./pktgen_perf.sh B:D.f CmptLen_PfchEN ...
	where
	B:D.f is the PCI_ID of the device to be used for performance.
	CmptLen is completion entry size
	PfchEN is prefetch enable(1)/disable(0)
4. Example command: ./pktgen_perf.sh 02:00.0 8_0 16_1
This command will run pktgen performance on 02:00.0 device for 8 byte descriptor size with prefetch disable and 16 byte descriptor with prefetch enable.
Note that H2C perforamnce will be taken for only first combination of descriptor size and prefetch.

5. test_{dsc_size}_{pfch_enabled}.csv file will be generated containing all performance report for different queues and packet sizes.
