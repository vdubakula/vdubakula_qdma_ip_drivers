# Xilinx QDMA

The Xilinx PCI Express Multi Queue DMA (QDMA) IP provides high-performance direct memory access (DMA) via PCI Express. The PCIe QDMA can be implemented in UltraScale+ devices.

Both the linux kernel driver and the DPDK driver can be run on a PCI Express root port host PC to interact with the QDMA endpoint IP via PCI Express.
